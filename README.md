## A Project Management tool

A Project Management tool with a Rails back-end, using JSON, and a ReactJS front-end.
We worked on this project in a team of 4, during our 5-week Web Developer Bootcamp.
We built the initial version in 1 week.

This project will be a work-in-progress, as I'm planning to improve this and add more features to practice my skills.

### Info
Four weeks into our [Codaisseur's](https://github.com/Codaisseur) Web Dev Bootcamp, we had to build a Rails api (JSON) and use ReactJS as the [front-end](https://github.com/irisbune/Check_projectmanager-front).

The api was build using BDD, using RSpec to test our code.
The assignment for the back-end was to write at least 2 model specs and 4 controller specs.
We managed to add some tests to validate a task's due dates.

### Todos
My personal goal is to add:
- Complete specs for current functionality, incl. views.
- User Model
  - Features:
      - invite users to projects
      - assign users to tasks
      - see open & closed tasks per user
- Comment Model
  - Features:
      - comment on tasks
